1. Visibility - This principle emphasizes the importance of making information visible and easy to find. Users should be able to easily 
understand what is available to them and how to access it. This can be achieved through clear labeling, intuitive navigation, and 
appropriate use of visual hierarchy.

2. Feedback - Users should receive feedback in response to their actions, whether it's confirming a successful operation or alerting 
them to an error. Feedback helps users understand what is happening and what they need to do to accomplish their goals.

3. Constraints - Constraints help users understand what is possible and guide them toward the correct action. This principle emphasizes 
the importance of limiting options and guiding users through the design, rather than overwhelming them with too many choices.

4. Consistency - Consistency is crucial in creating a design that is easy to use and understand. Users should be able to predict how the 
design will behave based on previous interactions, and elements should be consistent in their placement, labeling, and function.

5. Mapping - This principle refers to the relationship between the design and the real world. Users should be able to understand the 
design's functions and actions based on their knowledge of the real world. For example, a trash can icon should be used for deleting 
files because users associate throwing something in the trash with getting rid of it.

6. Flexibility - A design should be flexible enough to accommodate a range of users and their needs. This can be achieved through 
customizable settings, options for different languages, and other features that allow users to adapt the design to their preferences.

7. Error prevention and recovery - This principle emphasizes the importance of preventing errors from occurring in the first place, and 
providing users with a clear path to recovery if they do make a mistake. Error messages should be helpful and informative, and users 
should be able to easily undo actions and return to a previous state.

8. Efficiency - Users should be able to accomplish their goals quickly and easily, with minimal steps and distractions. This principle 
emphasizes the importance of designing for speed and efficiency, without sacrificing usability.

9. Memorability - A design should be memorable and easy to recall, even after a period of disuse. This can be achieved through 
consistent labeling, visual cues, and other features that help users remember how to accomplish their goals.

10. Learnability - Users should be able to learn how to use the design quickly and easily. This principle emphasizes the importance of 
clear instructions, intuitive navigation, and other features that help users understand the design and accomplish their goals.
