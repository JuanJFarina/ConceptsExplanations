## Arrays:

Arrays are a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations. In all three languages, arrays can be used to store and manipulate data in an ordered sequence. Arrays in JavaScript and Python can hold elements of different data types, while Java arrays must contain elements of the same type.

## Linked Lists:

A linked list is a data structure in which each element, called a node, contains a value and a reference to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists can be used to implement stacks, queues, and other abstract data types. In all three languages, linked lists can be implemented using pointers or references.

## Stacks:

A stack is a data structure that stores elements in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) order. Elements can only be added or removed from the top of the stack. Stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists in all three languages.

## Queues:

A queue is a data structure that stores elements in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order. Elements can only be added to the back of the queue and removed from the front. Queues can be implemented using arrays or linked lists in all three languages.

## Hash Tables:

A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs in a way that allows for constant-time access to values based on their keys. Hash tables can be implemented using arrays in JavaScript and Python, and using classes and interfaces in Java.

## Trees:

Trees are hierarchical data structures in which each node has zero or more child nodes. Trees can be used to represent hierarchical relationships, such as the file system in an operating system. Trees can be implemented using classes and interfaces in Java, and using classes and dictionaries in Python and JavaScript.

## Graphs:

A graph is a collection of nodes and edges that connect them. Graphs can be used to model complex relationships, such as social networks or transportation systems. Graphs can be implemented using classes and interfaces in Java, and using dictionaries and arrays in Python and JavaScript.

## Heaps:

A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. In a min-heap, for example, the parent nodes are always smaller than their children. Conversely, in a max-heap, the parent nodes are always greater than their children.

Heaps are often used to implement priority queues, where the highest or lowest priority element is always at the root. Heaps are also used in sorting algorithms like heapsort.

Heaps can be implemented in JavaScript, Java, and Python using arrays or linked lists. In JavaScript, an array can be used to represent a heap. In Java and Python, there are built-in classes like PriorityQueue and heapq that implement heaps.
