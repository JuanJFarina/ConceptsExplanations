These were devised by Dieter Rams.

1. Good design is innovative - According to Dieter Rams, innovation is an important aspect of good design. He believed that designers 
should always strive to create new and original solutions, rather than simply copying what has been done before. This principle emphasizes 
the importance of creativity and pushing boundaries to create designs that are unique and impactful.

2. Good design makes a product useful - The second principle of good design emphasizes the importance of usability. Rams believed that a 
good design should be functional and useful, with a clear purpose that fulfills the needs of the user. The design should be intuitive and 
easy to use, with features that enhance the user experience.

3. Good design is aesthetic - Aesthetics play a significant role in good design. Rams believed that a product should not only be 
functional but should also be visually pleasing. Aesthetics should be considered in all aspects of the design, including the shape, form, 
color, texture, and material.

4. Good design makes a product understandable - A good design should be easily understandable to the user. Rams believed that a product 
should be designed with the user in mind, with a clear and concise design that communicates the product's purpose and function. The 
design should be intuitive and easy to understand, without the need for complicated instructions.

5. Good design is unobtrusive - A good design should be subtle and not impose itself on the user. Rams believed that a product should be 
designed to blend seamlessly into the user's environment, without drawing attention away from its function.

6. Good design is honest - Honesty is an important principle of good design. Rams believed that a product's design should be transparent, 
with a clear representation of its function and purpose. Designers should not mislead the user or create designs that are purely for 
aesthetic purposes.

7. Good design is long-lasting - A good design should be durable and able to withstand the test of time. Rams believed that a product 
should be designed with quality materials and construction, ensuring that it can last for years without needing to be replaced.

8. Good design is thorough down to the last detail - Good design should be well-thought-out and consider all aspects of the product, 
down to the smallest detail. Rams believed that attention to detail is crucial in creating a cohesive and functional design.

9. Good design is environmentally friendly - A good design should take into account the impact it has on the environment. Rams believed 
that designers should consider the product's entire lifecycle, including its production, use, and disposal, and strive to create 
designs that are sustainable and minimize waste.

10. Good design is as little design as possible - According to Rams, good design should be simple and not overcomplicated. The design 
should only include the necessary features and elements, without any extraneous details that could distract from the product's 
function. This principle emphasizes the importance of simplicity and minimalism in good design.
